1. Collisions on left paddle work but are pretty hard to actually get
   since it just makes sure that the ball is within the paddle as it
   tries to pass the paddle. This lets the ball go diagonally past the
   paddle very easily.

2. A lot of our CMP checks are pretty primitive. Since in one direction
   they check less than and in the other direction greater than or equal
   to, they might be slightly different depending on the direction.

3. Paddle or ball speed greater than 1 can cause the object to exceed what
   its bounds are meant to be. We should move them in a bit and/or change
   the boundary checks to act while next movement is being calculated rather
   than after.
