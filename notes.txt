1. Collisions are better since if the ball is within the paddle vertically
   while passing through it then it will count as a hit. The ball can still
   pass through diagonally since it's not perfect rectangle collision but
   it is much better than before.

2. A lot of our CMP checks are pretty primitive. Since in one direction
   they check less than and in the other direction greater than or equal
   to, they might be slightly different depending on the direction.

3. Paddle or ball speed greater than 1 can cause the object to exceed what
   its bounds are meant to be. We should move them in a bit and/or change
   the boundary checks to act while next movement is being calculated rather
   than after.
